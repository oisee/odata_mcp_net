# Release Notes

## Version 1.0.1 (In Development)

### üéØ Major Improvements

#### Fixed Critical ID Type Mismatch
- **Issue**: Integer IDs were incorrectly formatted as strings (e.g., `Products('1')` instead of `Products(1)`)
- **Impact**: All GET, UPDATE, and DELETE operations failed with 400 Bad Request
- **Resolution**: Enhanced `FormatKeyValue` to properly handle all OData primitive types

#### Achieved Tool Parity with Go Implementation
- Both implementations now expose exactly 20 tools for the test OData service
- Removed non-functional search tools that were causing 400 errors
- Function imports (like `GetProductsByRating`) now work correctly

#### Improved Type System Support
- Proper formatting for: Int16, Int32, Int64, Double, Decimal, Boolean, DateTimeOffset
- Correct handling of GUID types with `guid'...'` syntax
- String types properly quoted with single quotes

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed GetProductsByRating function execution (was throwing internal errors)
- Removed search functions that don't work with OData V2 services
- Fixed metadata parsing for V2 services with function imports
- Improved error logging and debugging infrastructure

### üìù Documentation Updates

- Updated README to reflect actual capabilities
- Added Known Issues section for Debug vs Release build difference
- Clarified that search functionality is not available for V2 services
- Added troubleshooting guide for common issues

### üîß Technical Improvements

- Added comprehensive debugging infrastructure inspired by MinZ
- Replaced file-based debug logging with proper structured logging
- Added V2-specific metadata parser for better compatibility
- Improved tool name suffix generation for multi-server environments

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **Debug vs Release Build**: Release builds currently fail with certain operations. Use Debug builds for Claude Desktop integration.
- **Write Operations**: Create/Update operations may fail on read-only demo services
- **Date Format**: .NET uses `/Date(timestamp)/` format vs ISO format (cosmetic difference)

### üöÄ Next Steps

- Investigate and fix Release build issue
- Add metadata validation for CRUD operations
- Implement automated test suite
- Add performance benchmarking
